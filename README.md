## Why I Chose My Data Structure
I used SQL tables because it is good for structured data with fixed fields such as name, email, and department.

## The Differences Between SQL and NoSQL
SQL requires defining tables and columns before inserting data. NoSQL allows you to put in documents without a strict definition. 

SQL stores data in tables and rows, while NoSQL stores data as documents inside collections.

## Which Felt More Efficient and Why
NoSQL felt more efficient to me when inserting and modifying data as it does not require any changes to the schema.
