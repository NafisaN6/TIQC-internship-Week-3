## Why I Chose My Data Structure
I used SQL tables because it is good for structured data.

## The Differences Between SQL and MongoDB
The differences I notced were that MySQL and MongoDB each store data differently. MySQL uses tables with rows and columns and requires to have a fixed structure, while MongoDB stores data in much more flexible documents which can change. MySQL was better for organizing data, but MongoDB was easier and faster to use when adding or changing data.

## Which Felt More Efficient and Why
MongoDB felt more efficient to me when inserting and modifying data as it is more flexible.
